// The Story:
// Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.

// Task Overview:
// You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

// cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
// on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
// wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
// If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

// Usage Examples:
// cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
// cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting

// Exclusive "or" (xor) Logical Operator
// Overview
// In some scripting languages like PHP, there exists a logical operator (e.g. &&, ||, and, or, etc.) called the "Exclusive Or" (hence the name of this Kata). The exclusive or evaluates two booleans. It then returns true if exactly one of the two expressions are true, false otherwise. For example:

// true xor false == true // exactly one of the two expressions are true
// false xor true == true // exactly one of the two expressions are true
// true xor true == false // Both are true.  "xor" only returns true if EXACTLY one of the two expressions evaluate to true.
// Task
// Since we cannot define keywords in Javascript (well, at least I don't know how to do it), your task is to define a function xor(a, b) where a and b are the two expressions to be evaluated.

//       |       ----your function name
//       |       |    ---if needed, some arguments will appear in parentheses

//     function myfunc(){  ---------your function code will starting with "{"
//       //you should type your code here
//     }----------------------------ending with "}"
// If we want to print some to the screen, maybe we can use Document.write() in the web, or use alert() pop your message, but Codewars did not support these methods, we should use console.log() in your function. see this example:

// function printWordToScreen(){
//   var somewords="This is an example."
//   console.log(somewords)
// }
// If we run this function, This is an example. will be seen on the screen. As you see, console.log() is an useful method. You will use it a lot!

// Task
// Please refer to two example above and write your first JS function.

// mission 1:

// use keyword function to define your function, function name should be helloWorld(don't forget the () and {})

// mission 2:

// use keyword var (or let or const) to define a variable str, value of str should be a string: "Hello World!"(don't forget the =).

// mission 3:

// type the console.log() in the next line (don't forget to put the str in the parentheses).

// When you have finished the work, click "Run Tests" to see if your code is working properly.

// In the end, click "Submit" to submit your code pass this kata.

// Task

// In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

// The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

// Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

// You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

// The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.
// Examples:
